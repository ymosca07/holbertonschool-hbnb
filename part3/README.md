### Introduction to Part 3: Enhanced Backend with Authentication and Database Integration

Welcome to Part 3 of the **HBnB Project**, where you will extend the backend of the application by introducing **user authentication**, **authorization**, and **database integration** using **SQLAlchemy** and **SQLite** for development. Later, you'll configure **MySQL** for production environments. In this part, you will secure the backend, introduce persistent storage, and prepare the application for a scalable, real-world deployment.

#### Objectives of the Project
1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement JWT-based user authentication using **Flask-JWT-Extended** and role-based access control with the `is_admin` attribute for specific endpoints.
2. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with **SQLite** for development using **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM and prepare for **MySQL** for production.
3. **CRUD Operations with Database Persistence**: Refactor all CRUD operations to interact with a persistent database.
4. **Database Design and Visualization**: Design the database schema using **mermaid.js** and ensure all relationships between entities are correctly mapped.
5. **Data Consistency and Validation**: Ensure that data validation and constraints are properly enforced in the models.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this part, you will:
- Implement **JWT authentication** to secure your API and manage user sessions.
- Enforce **role-based access control** to restrict access based on user roles (regular users vs. administrators).
- Replace in-memory repositories with a **SQLite-based persistence layer** using **SQLAlchemy** for development and configure **MySQL** for production.
- Design and visualize a **relational database schema** using **mermaid.js** to handle relationships between users, places, reviews, and amenities.
- Ensure the backend is secure, scalable, and provides reliable data storage for production environments.

#### Project Context
In the previous parts of the project, you worked with in-memory storage, which is ideal for prototyping but insufficient for production environments. In Part 3, you'll transition to **SQLite**, a lightweight relational database, for development, while preparing the system for **MySQL** in production. This will give you hands-on experience with real-world database systems, allowing your application to scale effectively.

Additionally, you'll introduce **JWT-based authentication** to secure the API, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with certain endpoints. You will also implement role-based access control to enforce restrictions based on the user's privileges (regular users vs. administrators).

#### Project Resources
Here are some resources that will guide you through this part of the project:
- **JWT Authentication**: [Flask-JWT-Extended Documentation](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: [SQLAlchemy Documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/)
- **SQLite**: [SQLite Documentation](https://sqlite.org/docs.html)
- **MySQL**: [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
- **Flask Documentation**: [Flask Official Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- **Mermaid.js for ER Diagrams**: [Mermaid.js Documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

#### Structure of the Project
In this part of the project, the tasks are organized in a way that builds progressively towards a complete, secure, and database-backed backend system:

1. **Modify the User Model to Include Password**: You will start by modifying the `User` model to store passwords securely using bcrypt2 and update the user registration logic.
2. **Implement JWT Authentication**: Secure the API using JWT tokens, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
3. **Implement Authorization for Specific Endpoints**: You will implement role-based access control to restrict certain actions (e.g., admin-only actions).
4. **SQLite Database Integration**: Transition from in-memory data storage to **SQLite** as the persistent database during development.
5. **Map Entities Using SQLAlchemy**: Map existing entities (`User`, `Place`, `Review`, `Amenity`) to the database using SQLAlchemy and ensure relationships are well-defined.
6. **Prepare for MySQL in Production**: Towards the end of this phase, you’ll configure the application to use **MySQL** in production and **SQLite** for development.
7. **Database Design and Visualization**: Use **mermaid.js** to create entity-relationship diagrams for your database schema.

Each task is carefully designed to build on previous work and ensure the system transitions smoothly from development to production readiness.

---

By the end of Part 3, you will have a backend that not only stores data in a persistent and secure database but also ensures that only authorized users can access and modify specific data. You will have implemented industry-standard authentication and database management practices that are crucial for real-world web applications.
